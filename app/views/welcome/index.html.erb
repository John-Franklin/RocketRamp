  <div class="row panel panel-body panel-default"><h3>Final Project</h3>
<a href="http://campusconnection.parseapp.com">Campus Connection</a> is designed to be an improvement upon Craigslist for college students that will use Solr and data analytics to find valuable information that Craigslist cannot, like the average price of a used iPhone in your area. Campus Connection is based in the MEAN stack using Parse to handle MongoDB. For now, this data analytics isn't implemented, but the website is functional and certainly looks nicer than Craigslist.

  Project Stagehand:</h3>
  <p>
  <a href="http://cmpe165-server.herokuapp.com/">Project Stagehand</a> is an application designed to connect the participants of liver performances like flash-mobs. It's based in the MEAN stack as well.

  The interesting content here isn't in the front-end, but in the backend which uses Mongoose. It uses some clever code to create generic routes for each model in the database, securing itself with permissions for each object; take a look at the code on GitHub.
</p><p>
  Unfortunately, it was never set up to inspect each directory for models so that it would run with any model files used for Mongoose due to lack of time. Also, Mongoose had a surprising restriction that only allows you to merge on a unique field labelled _id, requiring difficult workarounds because this wasn't known until late in development after the model names were firmly established in use in the code.

  Story Tools for Pivotal Tracker:</h3>
  <p>Story Tools for Pivotal Tracker is a javascript plugin for Google Chrome with over 300 users. It adds two features to Pivotal Tracker, a project management tool similar to JIRA. Those features were the ability to duplicate stories and the ability to convert stories with tasks into epics with stories. The former was so useful that it was eventually integrated into the website, which naturally renders that feature obsolete.
